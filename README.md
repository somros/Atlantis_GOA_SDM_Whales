# Spatial distributions of cetaceans in Atlantis GOA

This code produces distribution maps of cetaceans in Atlantis GOA.  

At the time of writing, there are not detailed and / or spatially annotated counts for most cetaceans in the GOA. We map sightings presented in [Rone et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-016-3052-2) to the Atlantis GOA geometry to obtain crude cross-shelf distributions of the Atlantis GOA groups `Dolphins`, `Killer_transient`, `Killer_resident`, `Whale_humpback`, `WHale_baleen`, `Whale_tooth`.
